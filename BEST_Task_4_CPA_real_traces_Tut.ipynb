The attack code is the same as you developed in the previous task. However, the traces here are different from the simulated traces. Unlike simulated traces, where you have one leakage value/leakage point (HW/HD) per round, here you shall see several leakage points per round. The number of leakage points depends on the sampling frequency of the oscilloscope. It is time-consuming to consider each leakage point in the trace for analysis. Hence, we shall focus on leakages corresponding to the final round of AES. It is straightforward to save only the last round traces from the oscilloscope.       \n","\n","In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to perform the same attack on misaligned traces. As you shall see, random misalignment works as a countermeasure for preventing CPA."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z0Xfm3pICF_2"},"source":["# **Part-1: Download Attack Traces**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Q2-xA1fQo6IT","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739603826519,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5172,"user":{"displayName":"Soumi Chatterjee","userId":"00933951630081219214"}},"outputId":"1a1c9466-031e-4957-f37f-6e59abd0bbde"},"source":["!wget \"https://tinyurl.com/y52fhdxs\"\n","!unzip y52fhdxs\n","!rm y52fhdxs"],"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2025-02-15 07:17:00--  https://tinyurl.com/y52fhdxs\n","Resolving tinyurl.com (tinyurl.com)... 104.18.111.161, 104.17.112.233, 2606:4700::6811:70e9, ...\n","Connecting to tinyurl.com (tinyurl.com)|104.18.111.161|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 301 Moved Permanently\n","Location: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1bI3O78aJGEUZwzUjQC41dL08A2jEwdlb [following]\n","--2025-02-15 07:17:00--  https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1bI3O78aJGEUZwzUjQC41dL08A2jEwdlb\n","Resolving drive.google.com (drive.google.com)... 142.251.2.102, 142.251.2.101, 142.251.2.139, ...\n","Connecting to drive.google.com (drive.google.com)|142.251.2.102|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 303 See Other\n","Location: https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1bI3O78aJGEUZwzUjQC41dL08A2jEwdlb&export=download [following]\n","--2025-02-15 07:17:01--  https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1bI3O78aJGEUZwzUjQC41dL08A2jEwdlb&export=download\n","Resolving drive.usercontent.google.com (drive.usercontent.google.com)... 74.125.137.132, 2607:f8b0:4023:c03::84\n","Connecting to drive.usercontent.google.com (drive.usercontent.google.com)|74.125.137.132|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 8039133 (7.7M) [application/octet-stream]\n","Saving to: ‘y52fhdxs’\n","\n","y52fhdxs            100%[===================>]   7.67M  42.4MB/s    in 0.2s    \n","\n","2025-02-15 07:17:04 (42.4 MB/s) - ‘y52fhdxs’ saved [8039133/8039133]\n","\n","Archive:  y52fhdxs\n","  inflating: _DATA1_keyset_9_attack.csv  \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rRnOIs7eCTSi"},"source":["## **Part 2: Download Misaligned Traces**"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"cJLe_xh18M5u","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739603798107,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5566,"user":{"displayName":"Soumi Chatterjee","userId":"00933951630081219214"}},"outputId":"d23daf06-995f-4f57-848a-9962a3780d28"},"source":["!wget \"https://tinyurl.com/yxev9dpk\"\n","!unzip yxev9dpk\n","!rm yxev9dpk"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2025-02-15 07:16:31--  https://tinyurl.com/yxev9dpk\n","Resolving tinyurl.com (tinyurl.com)... 104.18.111.161, 104.17.112.233, 2606:4700::6811:70e9, ...\n","Connecting to tinyurl.com (tinyurl.com)|104.18.111.161|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 301 Moved Permanently\n","Location: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dFrDg4gJMslONaUz_Wqz5PM8ZXwaXUPw [following]\n","--2025-02-15 07:16:32--  https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1dFrDg4gJMslONaUz_Wqz5PM8ZXwaXUPw\n","Resolving drive.google.com (drive.google.com)... 142.251.2.102, 142.251.2.101, 142.251.2.139, ...\n","Connecting to drive.google.com (drive.google.com)|142.251.2.102|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 303 See Other\n","Location: https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1dFrDg4gJMslONaUz_Wqz5PM8ZXwaXUPw&export=download [following]\n","--2025-02-15 07:16:32--  https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1dFrDg4gJMslONaUz_Wqz5PM8ZXwaXUPw&export=download\n","Resolving drive.usercontent.google.com (drive.usercontent.google.com)... 74.125.137.132, 2607:f8b0:4023:c03::84\n","Connecting to drive.usercontent.google.com (drive.usercontent.google.com)|74.125.137.132|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 13096025 (12M) [application/octet-stream]\n","Saving to: ‘yxev9dpk’\n","\n","yxev9dpk            100%[===================>]  12.49M  37.7MB/s    in 0.3s    \n","\n","2025-02-15 07:16:35 (37.7 MB/s) - ‘yxev9dpk’ saved [13096025/13096025]\n","\n","Archive:  yxev9dpk\n","  inflating: misalign_trace.csv      \n"]}]}]}
